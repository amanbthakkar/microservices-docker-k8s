client: the react website as frontend
posts: service to create new posts, and then send post creation event to event-bus
comments: service to create new commends, and send events to event-bus
moderation: takes each comment and checks if 'orange' is present in the service or not
query: the actual microservice which runs and returns the values to client

infra: the docker and k8s setup

nodemon: to restart servers automatically
cors: to prevent errors when browser requests are made across domain names (have to be server side  implementation)
i think internal requests are fine, and thus since event-bus is not accessible from browser,
it doesn't need to handle cors
